**Project - Kannada MNIST - Classification Problem**
This repository contains the implementation of a classification problem involving Kannada digits using various machine learning models. The goal is to classify 
handwritten Kannada digits into their respective classes using different techniques and evaluate their performance.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Kannada MNIST dataset, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset is divided into 60,000 
training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is of size 28x28 pixels.
